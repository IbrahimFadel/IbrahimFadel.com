		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<p>I am a highschool student who loves to <span class="accent">make</span> things. I haven&apos;t figured out
			which area I love the most yet, but so far I&apos;ve been dabbling in webdev, game design, compiler design
			as well as just random projects :) Aside from coding, I love global politics and <span
				class="accent">writing</span>.</p>

				<h1>Sandscript</h1>
				<p>This project started off as a way for me to learn C++. I was bored by all the examples online, so I
					decided I would try to make a programming language (because I heard people did those in C++).
					Originally, it was just a simple interpreted language that looked sort of like Typescript. It wasn't
					very interesting, but it had variables, functions, and some basic control flow.</p>
				<p>Eventually, I decided to take it a step forward and make it <span class="accent">compiled</span>. I
					came across LLVM -- a super incredible project that can handle all the codegen. Using LLVM, I built
					my first attempt at a compiler. I&apos;ve been rewriting and rewriting for a long time now trying to
					land on a version i&apos;m happy with (still not there).</p>
				<p>This whole project ended up leading me down the rabbit whole of lower level programming. In general,
					i&apos;ve much more interested in the low level aspects of computers and compilers in general, and
					it&apos; been nice exploring those.</p>

				<h1>RorkeJS</h1>
				<p>When I first really got into programming, I make a lot of basic game with a framework called <a
						target="__blank" href="https://phaser.io/" class="accent">Phaser</a>. After a while, I got bored
					and decided to try to make my own game framework. RorkeJS is quite similar to Phaser -- it uses the
					<a target="__blank" href="https://www.pixijs.com/" class="accent">PixiJS</a> webGL renderer, and has
					a similar design in general.
				</p>
				<p>Much like most of my projects, I&apos;ve rewritten it too many times to count. I haven&apos;t touched
					the project in a while though. This project can handle physics, animations, input and all the other
					tools you need to make an extremely basic game in the browser.</p>

				<h1>SIRC</h1>
				<p>SIRC (Simple IRC) is just a basic IRC client. I initially took inspiration from <a target="__blank"
						href="https://github.com/dylanaraps/birch" class="accent">birch</a> -- I had never heard of IRC
					and it intrigued me. I decided to take a crack at it and make a terminal based client.</p>
				<p>I made it in Typescript because I&apos;d been meaning to start using it more and get more used to it.
					After figuring out how to establish a connection to an IRC server and how to send commands, I
					basically just implemented some of the IRC protocol (not very much of it). Basically all you can do
					is connect to a server, join & leave channels, and send messages. It&apos;s not very exciting, but
					it works and I think it looks decent.</p>
				<p>Looking through the codebase, I see remnants of times I tried making it into a TUI, and other parts
					that I never ended up cleaning up. I definitely want to go back and refactor it a bunch when I get
					the time.</p>

		<h1>Some other Experience</h1>

		<p>I, along with a few friends, run the Amnesty International club at my school. There, we learn and spread
			awareness about humanitarian crises. We aim to write plenty of articles which we publish for students at our
			school.</p>

		<p>I am also part of the executive team at <a class="accent" target="__blank"
				href="https://worldaffairs.ucc.on.ca">WAC</a>, an annual student-led conference. I work on the tech team
			where we hosted the conference online for the first time ever, and maintain the website and registration
			system.</p>
