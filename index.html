			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<p>I am a highschool student who loves to <span class="accent">make</span> things. I haven&apos;t figured out which area I love the most yet, but so far I&apos;ve been dabbling in webdev, game design, compiler design as well as just random projects :) Aside from coding, I love global politics and <span class="accent">writing</span>.</p>

					<h1>Sandscript</h1>
					<p>This project started off as a way for me to learn C++. I was bored by all the examples online, so I decided I would try to make a programming language (because I heard people did those in C++). Originally, it was just a simple interpreted language that looked sort of like Typescript. It wasn't very interesting, but it had variables, functions, and some basic control flow.</p>
					<p>Eventually, I decided to take it a step forward and make it <span class="accent">compiled</span>. I came across LLVM -- a super incredible project that can handle all the codegen. Using LLVM, I built my first attempt at a compiler. I&apos;ve been rewriting and rewriting for a long time now trying to land on a version i&apos;m happy with (still not there).</p>
					<p>This whole project ended up leading me down the rabbit whole of lower level programming. In general, i&apos;ve much more interested in the low level aspects of computers and compilers in general, and it&apos; been nice exploring those.</p>

					<h1>RorkeJS</h1>
					<p>When I first really got into programming, I make a lot of basic game with a framework called <a target="__blank" href="https://phaser.io/" class="accent">Phaser</a>. After a while, I got bored and decided to try to make my own game framework. RorkeJS is quite similar to Phaser -- it uses the <a target="__blank" href="https://www.pixijs.com/" class="accent">PixiJS</a> webGL renderer, and has a similar design in general.</p>
					<p>Much like most of my projects, I&apos;ve rewritten it too many times to count. I haven&apos;t touched the project in a while though. This project can handle physics, animations, input and all the other tools you need to make an extremely basic game in the browser.</p>

					<h1>SIRC</h1>
					<p>SIRC (Simple IRC) is just a basic IRC client. I initially took inspiration from <a target="__blank" href="https://github.com/dylanaraps/birch" class="accent">birch</a> -- I had never heard of IRC and it intrigued me. I decided to take a crack at it and make a terminal based client.</p>
					<p>I made it in Typescript because I&apos;d been meaning to start using it more and get more used to it. After figuring out how to establish a connection to an IRC server and how to send commands, I basically just implemented some of the IRC protocol (not very much of it). Basically all you can do is connect to a server, join & leave channels, and send messages. It&apos;s not very exciting, but it works and I think it looks decent.</p>
					<p>Looking through the codebase, I see remnants of times I tried making it into a TUI, and other parts that I never ended up cleaning up. I definitely want to go back and refactor it a bunch when I get the time.</p>

				<p>
					I'm currently starting my junior year of highschool in Toronto,
					Ontario!
				</p>
				<p>I like trying to make cool things with code</p>
				<p>
					Unfortunately, I'm quite 'creatively challenged' so I tend to stick to
					less visual projects
				</p>
				<p>
					Most of my projects go unfinished (48 github repos) -- usually because
					I've thought of something "more interesting" to do. Although, a few
					are done enough to show here!

								tl;dr Sandscript is a small compiler i&apos;m making with C++ &
								LLVM. It&apos;s nowhere near done or even at a state resembling
								a real language -- but every time i rewrite it I get a bit
								better, and looks a bit cleaner.

								tl;dr Simple IRC -- this project was my attempt at creating a
								tiny IRC client in Typescript. It's not nearly as feature
								complete as most IRC clients(all you can do is join channels,
								and message people) but it was mostly just to learn about
								implementing a protocol like IRC.

								tl;dr After switching from Itunes to Spotify I was upset that
								spotify didn't have an simplified view where you can only see
								album art and play status. I made a little program that runs

							<h1>Itunes to Spotify</h1>
							<p>
								tl;dr Python script that moves itunes playlists to spotify. Not
								close to perfect -- but I was able to transfer roughly 95% of my
								songs with pretty good accuracy. Overall, much easier than doing
								it manually(and not limited to 200 songs like some services I
								found). Looking back though, it&apos;s way too verbose.

								tl;dr RorkeJS is a little game library I made with PixiJS(WebGL

								bare-bones but enough to make a small game.
